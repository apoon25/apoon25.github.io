    <h1>My about me project</h1>
    <p>I am 11 and I have 4 family members, dad, mom, and a older brother. My family lives in malavern and I go to Great Valley Middle School. My favorite subject is math and social studies. The sports I play are basketball and tennis.I am obsesssed with playing board games and love to ride my bike around my neighborhood with my friends. Some food I like are pizza, burritos, and rice with pork.I love to watch football and basketball on TV. The instrument I play is violin. Other things I do in my spare time is read my comic book and build random things out of legos. When i'm bored I watch TV or do my homework. When I grow up I want to be an IT. Every year my family and I go on vacation. Last year we went to Cancun, Cancun is in Mexico City and is a great vacation resort. It is a great vacation place because there is a lot of activities you can do such as ziplining, atv driving, bowling, and swimming with dolphins. Our favorite hotel resort is Moon Palace, the hotel provides all meals through out the day. This year we are planning to Jamaica with a couple of friends. This is the first time we are going, so it is going to be fun!</p>
